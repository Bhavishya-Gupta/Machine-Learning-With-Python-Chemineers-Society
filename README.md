## This is project intoducing  basics of Machine Learning 
### Assignment 1: 
#### It is based on aplications of Important useful libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
### Assignment 2:
#### It is based on implementing linear regression using scratcch as well as linear regression by using sklearn then compared it on air quality dataset. 
### Assignment 3:
#### It is based on implementing impoortant machine learnings alogrithms for classiification : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithms.Then comparing the  accuracy score on test dataset.
